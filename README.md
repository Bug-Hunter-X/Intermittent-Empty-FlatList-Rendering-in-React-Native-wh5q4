# Intermittent Empty FlatList Rendering in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a `FlatList` component in React Native intermittently renders an empty list even when data is successfully fetched from an API. The issue is not consistent and doesn't always reproduce.

## Bug Description

The application fetches data from a remote API.  Sometimes the data is fetched without any errors, but the `FlatList` remains empty. The network request appears successful, and the data is available in the component's state, yet the UI doesn't update correctly.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the application on an Android or iOS emulator/device.
4. Observe that the FlatList will sometimes render empty even with successful API calls.

## Solution

The solution involves using `useEffect` hook with a dependency array to ensure that the component re-renders when the data changes.  Ensuring the data structure is compatible with the Flatlist helps resolve the issue.
